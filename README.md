# Backend Music Library

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I built this project in order to expand my knowledge on jest and Javascript, and to put my skills to the test with what I have learnt through my course.
My music library solves the problem of having a neat and convenient way to store your favourite artists, and it allows you and others to see more about that artsit and the albums they have released.
From this project I have learnt how to use Postman and the API's to add artists and albums. I have also learnt more about express, and the syntax that comes with it.

## Features

The music-library features include:

- Adding an artist or album
- Being able to return your artists/album in a table
- updating artists/albums
- deleting artists/albums

This app was created with `@command-shift/create-backend-app`
